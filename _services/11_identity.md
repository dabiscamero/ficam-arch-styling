Identity Management is the set of practices that allow an
organization to establish, maintain, and terminate identities.

An **IDENTITY** is the set of characteristics (also called
“attributes”) that describe an individual within a given
context:

* Your identity within the context of the Department of
Motor Vehicles (DMV) is different from your identity
within the context of your bank.

* Similarly, a person who is both a government
contractor and an Army Reservist will have two
identities, one in each context. These identities are
often called “personas”.

Identities change and evolve over time (you may get a
promotion, change your hair color, or receive additional
training) and may be terminated (you may turn in your
driver’s license when you move to another state), but
identities do not expire.

**IDENTITY PROOFING** is the process by which an identity is
first established. This process can be simple or complicated,
depending on the Level of Assurance (strength) that is
required of the identity:

* The process for a frequent shopper program at the
local grocery store is weak.

* The processes required by the DMV is stronger,
typically requiring multiple forms of evidence, such as
leases, mortgages, and utility bills.

* The process required by the Federal Government is
stronger still.

An **IDENTIFIER** is a unique attribute that can be used to
locate a specific identity within its context:

* While the DMV may issue many driver’s licenses bearing
the same name (there is more than one John Smith in
the state), each will have a different driver’s license
number.

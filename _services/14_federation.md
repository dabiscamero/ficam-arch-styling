Federation is the ability of one organization to accept another
organization’s work. Federation is based on inter-organizational trust.
The trusting organization has to be comfortable that the trusted
organization has similar policies, and that those policies are being
followed:

* A credential issued by your local library will not likely be trusted
by the security staff at the White House.

* A credential issued by your bank may be trusted by your health
club.

* A PIV credential issued by the Federal Government may be trusted by your State to access a website

Federation can occur at different points within ICAM. Examples include:

* An organization can accept credentials issued by another organization,
but still authenticate and authorize the individual locally:
  * A passport issued by the U.S. Department of State is accepted as a
valid credential by a foreign country, but that country’s immigration
office still authenticates the holder and requires a visa
(authorization).

* An organization can accept specific characteristics (attributes) describing
an individual from another organization:
  * Your bank will request your credit score from one of the credit
bureaus, rather than maintaining that information itself.

* An organization can accept an authorization decision from another
organization:
  * A driver’s license authorizing you to drive in one state is accepted by
another.

### Federation Services

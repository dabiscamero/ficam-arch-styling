When an employee or contractor on-boards at an agency, their identity information is collected and stored to act as their digital proxy in IT systems. This information is stored within an identity record, which may be modified or deleted as needed.
Once this digital identity record is established, it may be pushed to other systems from an authoritative source and provisioned access permissions (see Manage Entitlements).

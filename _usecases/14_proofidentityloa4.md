title: 4. Proof an Identity at Level of Assurance 4
collection: usecases
---

This use case describes the process for completing identity proofing at Level of Assurance 4 (LOA4), which allows an individual to receive an LOA4 credential. LOA4 identity proofing must be completed in person and requires the most robust process for verifying the individual’s claimed identity.

**Pre-condition:** A need has been established for an individual to receive an LOA4 credential.

| ![1. Government ID Supplied](../../img/usecases/proof4s1.png)  | An individual presents a valid government issued ID.  |
| ![2. Government ID Verified](../../img/usecases/proof4s2.png)  | The government ID is verified with the organization that issued it.  |
| ![3. Additional Information Supplied](../../img/usecases/proof4s3.png)  | The individual presents a second form of government ID or an account number.  |
| ![4. Additional Information Verified](../../img/usecases/proof4s4.png)  | The approval authority verifies that the second form of ID matches the first form of ID, or verifies the account number.  |
| ![5. Confirmation](../../img/usecases/proof4s5.png)  | The approval authority confirms the individual’s contact information.  |
| ![6. Biometrics Captured](../../img/usecases/proof4s6.png)  | The individual’s biometric data is captured. <br/><em>A strong level of non-repudiation is achieved by capturing biometric data.</em>  |

**Post-condition:** The individual’s identity is proofed at LOA4.

title: 20. Accept Credentials in a Federation
collection: usecases
---

The term ‘federation’ describes an environment where an agency has established the tools and policies to accept identity and credential information from users at another organization, thus expanding secure access to individuals outside the organization.  Agencies might look to federate with other governmental bodies or private organizations in order to expand services, reduce costs, and improve overall efficiency.  
This use case shows the primary process for providing access to an outside individual in a federated environment.
